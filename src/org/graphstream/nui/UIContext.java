/**
 * A context is the main block in the creation of a new display interface. It
 * allows to load modules and to create views. This context is the link between
 * these elements and the graph who has to be displayed.
 * 
 * In the creation of a context, we consider two threads, A and B. The first
 * one, A, is the one who manage the source of the event, a graph for example.
 * The second, B, is the one where the UI will be managed and the views will be
 * drawn. If A and B are the same thread, the {@link ThreadingModel} of the
 * context is {@link ThreadingModel.SOURCE_IN_UI_THREAD}. But if the UI has its
 * own thread, and so A and B are two different threads, the threading model
 * will be {@link ThreadingModel.SOURCE_IN_ANOTHER_THREAD}. The context HAS TO
 * be initialized inside the ui thread (ie. inside the B thread). The thread
 * used for initialization can be obtained by the {@link #getContextThread()}
 * method. Once the initialization is done, one can use the
 * {@link #connect(Source)} method inside the thread A to add a new source of
 * events.
 * 
 * The link between the sources you connect and all the elements of the ui is
 * done through a proxy, who can be obtained with {@link #getContextProxy()}.
 * 
 * Most of the methods of a context have to be used inside the context thread to
 * avoid concurrent troubles. If you need to control a module or a view, you
 * have to use the attributes of the source. The context will dispatch graph
 * attributes starting with the <code>ui.</code> prefix. The pattern is
 * <code>ui.moduleID.attribute</code> to send attribute to a module, or
 * <code>ui.views.viewID.attribute</code> to send attribute to a view.
