/**
 * One of the main parts of the ui is to maintain data in buffers that fit the
 * element indexes. Since there is dynamics, index of an element can change or
 * new elements can be added. So, one has to adapt the buffer to these changes.
 * 
 * The buffers module deals with these changes and adapt registered buffers, so
 * element datas always fit the index of elements.
 * 
 * When created, the new buffer can be accessed through a
 * {@link org.graphstream.nui.swapper.UIBufferReference}. Using the reference
 * rather than the buffer is an important point since the buffer itself can
 * change when we have to make it bigger.
