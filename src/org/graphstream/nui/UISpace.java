/**
 * The module UISpace allows to manage the space of the nodes coordinates. It is
 * composed of the lowest and highest points of this space such that nodes
 * positions have to be located between these two points.
 *
 * Several modes are available. The first one,
 * {@link org.graphstream.nui.UISpace.Mode.GROWING}, considers that the space
 * will grow according to the changes occurring in the nodes position. If one
 * position (x,y) changes, and if x is lower (resp. higher) than the abscissa of
 * the lowest (resp. highest) space point, then this lowest (resp. highest)
 * point will be updated. This is the same for the ordinate.
 * 
 * The second mode, {@link org.graphstream.nui.UISpace.Mode.ADAPTATIVE}, is
 * similar to the first one but it will keep a fixed distance between the lowest
 * and the highest nodes locations, so the space will grow according to changes,
 * but will decrease too.
 * 
 * The third one, {@link org.graphstream.nui.UISpace.Mode.FIXED}, allows just to
 * define the space but this space will not change according to the changes of
 * the nodes location. This mode can be used, for example, with a layout
 * algorithm to tell the layout what is the space of the graph.
 * 
 * The space parameters can be controlled directly from the graph using
 * attributes with a <code>ui.space.</code> prefix. Available attributes are :
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ui.space.mode</code> to control the mode of the space ;</li>
 * <li><code>ui.space.3d</code> ;</li>
 * <li><code>ui.space.lowest</code> linked to the lowest point of the space ;</li>
 * <li><code>ui.space.highest</code> linked to the highest point of the space.</li>
 * </ul>
